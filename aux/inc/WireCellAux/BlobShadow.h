/** Blob shadow.

    A "blob shadow" measures the amount of an "overlap" shared by a
    pair blobs.

    There are two definitions for shadow overlap which depend on the
    basis for their calculation.  They are qualifed either as "wire"
    or "channel" shadows.  For detectors with a single wire (segment)
    per channel (eg, no wrapped wires) the two are degenerate.  Two
    blobs may have a channel shadow because they have channels in
    common but may not have any shared wire segments so would lack any
    wire shadow.  The contrary may not arise. A pair of blobs with a
    wire shadow must also have a channel shadow.

    A shadow is characterized by the WirePlaneId and by its extent in
    the pitch direction as bound by extreme channel or wire indices.

    For a channel shadow, the WirePlaneId::face() value is not material
    due to wire wrapping.  The channel shadow bounds are given by a pair of
    wire-attachment-numbers such as as returned by IChannel::index().

    For a wire shadow, the WirePlaneId::face() value is meaningful
    even in for detectors with wrapped wires.  The wire shadow bounds
    are represented by a pair of wire-in-plane number such as returned
    by IWire::index().
    
    The collection of shadows is represented by a "channel shadow
    graph" or a "wire shadow graph" with each node representing a blob
    and an edge representing their shadow.  The edge provides
    parameters representing WirePlaneId and shadow extent.  A shadow
    graph holds a graph-level property which is a "char" giving the
    code 'w' if it holds wire shadows or 'c' if it holds channel
    shadows.
