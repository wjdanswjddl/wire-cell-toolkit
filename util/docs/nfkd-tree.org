#+title: Wire-Cell interface to nanoflann K-D Tree

* Overview

WCT provides ~WireCellUtil/NFKD.h~ API in the ~WireCell::NFKD~ namespace
to interface to the nanoflann package.  This API provides
simplification and uniformity compared to the native nanoflann API.
Unlike nanoflann's API being based on the user providing a "dataset
adapter" that uses index semantics to query values of the
k-dimensional point vectors, ~NFKD~ uses iterators.  This allows the
adapter to be used with a variety of underlying point collections.

* Performance

Tests to output performance metrics can be run with the following
command:

#+begin_example
SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug ./build/util/wcdoctest-util -tc='nfkd dataset performance*
#+end_example

A number of tests provided:

- monolithic {static,dynamic} :: the point store is a single ~Dataset~ with either static or dynamic k-d tree
- disjoint :: the point store is multiple ~Dataset~ with (necessarily) dynamic k-d tree

Summaries of benchmarks run on a single core of i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz
with 32785 points in the k-d tree for construction ("k-d") and the
"knn" and "radius" query type, each returning all points.  The "knn"
and "radius" values are for the queries with the largest result sets.
  

The test here is for a single dataset and a dynamic or static k-d
tree.

| (time ms for 32768) | k-d | knn | radius |
|---------------------+-----+-----+--------|
| monolithic dynamic  | 105 | 253 |      6 |
| monolithic static   | 104 | 243 |      6 |
|---------------------+-----+-----+--------|

The test space for disjoint datasets spans different total sizes of
point clouds and distributed over different numbers of datasets.

This is after some optimization of the k-d tree point lookup.  For a
fixed set of points, increasing the granularity by eight times leads
to doubling in construction time while query time is largely
unchanged.  Fixing the number of points per dataset leads to about
three times more construction or query time for a doubling of the
number of datasets.

* Testing 

To log performance metrics:

#+begin_example
 $ ./build/util/wcdoctest-util -ltc | grep 'nfkd dataset performance'

 $ SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug ./build/util/wcdoctest-util \
   -tc='nfkd dataset performance monolithic static'
#+end_example

To investigate performance optimization:

#+begin_example
 $ CPUPROFILE=nfkd-disjoint.prof \
   LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libprofiler.so.0 \
   ./build/util/wcdoctest-util -tc='nfkd dataset performance disjoint'
 $ google-pprof --lines --pdf ./build/util/wcdoctest-util nfkd-disjoint.prof > nfkd-disjoint.pdf
#+end_example
