* Intervals, trees, sets and maps.

An interval is a finite segment on some number line, 1D space.  It is
defined by its two endpoint values and if those endpoints are
considered inside (closed) or outside (open) the interval.

Generally, we will assume a /right-open/ interval meaning the lower
endpoint is considered inside the interval and the upper endpoint is
just outside the interval.  This is consistent with iteration ranges,
for example those from C++ or Python.  This choice also makes clear
when on right-open interval's upper endpoint is equal to another
right-open interval's lower endpoint that the two are not considered
overlapping.

An /interval tree/ is a data structure that allows (relatively) fast
insert, traversals and queries on a set of intervals.  Queries include
finding intervals that cover a point, an intersection of the collected
intervals with another, shortest interval containing two sets of
intervals ("hull").  These take into consideration closed vs open
endpoints.

When a container only holds intervals it is an /interval set/.  When
data is associated with each interval, an /interval map/ provides the
container.  In this case, when intervals overlap, the interval map
requires a way combined the data from the overlapping intervals.
Either the data type must support combination operations or the data
must be held in a container that does (eg a set).

* Rectangle map and regions

An interval is one dimensional.  The concepts described above can be
extended to two or more orthogonal dimensions.  Here we stick with two
and thus the interval map becomes a /rectangle map/.  After adding many
elemental rectangles and their associated data to the map we may
perform iterations and queries analogous to the ones described above
for the 1D interval map.

As with the 1D case, when rectangles are added, their overlap results
in smaller rectangular /regions/.  The data associated with the
elemental rectangles become /combined/ in some manner on these regions.
This can be seen in the figure below.  The green elemental rectangle
holding the data ~[b]~ and the yellow elemental rectangle holding ~[c]~
overlap to produce a region with the combination ~{b,c}~.

[[file:talks/test_rectangles_find.svg]]

To implement the 2D extension simply, each dimension is handled with
independent 1D interval maps.  This produces a dimensional hierarchy
as described.  Given a rectangle, its interval along the horizontal
X-axis is stored into a top level 1D interval map, called here an
/xmap/.  The data type for the values of an xmap is a 1D interval map
called a /ymap/.  As the name implies it maps 1D intervals along the
vertical Y-axis.  The data type of the ymap is that provided by the
user and the hierarchy ends.  Having the ymap hold a /zmap/ which then
holds user data would trivially extend this idea to a 3D /box map/, etc.

While conceptually simple and easy to implement, this hierarchy
results in each X-interval being applied through every value of Y.
This can be seen in the figure where the red rectangle ~[a]~ leads to
X-intervals on the blue rectangle ~[d]~ (and others) despite the have no
overlap.  This artifact will be exposed to various iteration and query
methods called on the rectangle map.  On the other hand, for a given X
interval, the intervals in the Y dimension have no such artifacts.  

Iteration and queries on a rectangle map follow this dimensional
hierarchy.  For example, in the center of the figure is a gray square
that intersects the elemental rectangles.  To determine the
intersection, first the 1D interval intersection along the X dimension
is found using the xmap.  Then with the returned ymaps, their
intersection along the square's Y interval are found.  The figure
colors these intersections which are summarized with this log output
from the test program.

#+begin_example
X<- [400,600) Y<- [400,600)
X-> [400,501.495) Y-> [400,408.36) {e}
X-> [400,501.495) Y-> [572.966,600) {b}
X-> [501.495,600) Y-> [400,408.36) {e}
X-> [501.495,600) Y-> [572.966,600) {b}
#+end_example

The first line gives the dimensions of the square and the remaining
lines iterate over the regions, showing their combined data.  Here,
each only has a single datum because the gray square does not happen
to overlap any regions formed from multiple elemental rectangles.


* WCT implementation

** Construction, inserting and iterating

In brief pseudocode:

#+begin_src c++
  #include "WireCellUtil/Rectangles.h"
  using namespace WireCell;
  
  // (1)
  using rec_t = Rectangles<int, char>;
  rec_t recs;
  
  // (2)
  recs.add(0,7, 0, 4, 'a');
  // (3)
  auto elem = rec_t::element_t(
      rec_t::rectangle_t(
          rec_t::interval_t(3,11),
          rec_t::interval_t(2, 6)), 'b');
  // (4)
  recs += elem;
  
  // (5)
  for (const auto& [rec, cs] : recs.regions()) {
      // (6)
      const auto& [xi, yi] = rec
      auto x1 = xi.lower();
      auto x2 = xi.upper();
      //...
  
      // (7)
      for (char c : cs) {
          // ...
      }
  }
#+end_src

Comments:

1. A ~Rectangles<Key,Value>~ is created.  The key is integer type and is
   that of the rectangle coordinates.  The value type is simply ~char~.
   By default, the data is held in a ~std::set<char>~ and additional
   template arguments allow for different value containers.

2. One rectangle and associated data is loaded.

3. An rectangle object can be also created and combined with the data
   to produce an "element" of the rectangle map.

4. The ~operator+=~ is another way to load the rectangle map and one
   which mimics the underlying ~boost::icl~ 1D Boost interval container
   library API.

5. The regions of the rectangle map are iterated, unpacking them
   directly into a rectangle object and a ~std::set<char>~ of combined
   data.

6. The rectangle object is unpacked into two intervals and some user
   operation is done.

7. The user data ~std::set<char>~ is iterated.

** Queries

Following the dimensional hierarchy the user is free to use the
various [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/icl/doc/html/boost_icl/interface/function_synopsis.html][~boost::icl~]] functions to perform various queries.  First on
the /xmap/ and then on the on or more /ymap/ objects returned from there.

The WCT ~Rectangles~ implementation provides one such query which is
used to produce the /intersection/ of the gray square and the regions as
described above and shown in the figure.

Continuing the pseudocode example from above, 

#+begin_src c++
  
  auto isec = recs.intersection(rec_t::interval_t(5,9),
                                rec_t::interval_t(3, 5))
  
    for (const auto& [rect, qs] : isec) {
        const auto& [qxi, qyi] = rect;
        // ...
    }
  
#+end_src

** Tests

There are several tests found at ~util/test/~:

- ~test_rectangles.cxx~ :: basic proof of principle
- ~test_rectangles2.cxx~ :: simple use of ~Rectangles~
- ~test_rectangles_find.cxx~ :: more full test of ~Rectangles~ 

The first two produce an [[http://www.eukleides.org/][eukleides]] file which can be rendered.  The
second produces an SVG similar to, but randomly different, from the
one shown in the figure above.
