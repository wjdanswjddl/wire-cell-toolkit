- Partition the transverse area for one /time-slice/ by removing all wires with signal below some threshold.
- The remaining contiguous regions are identified as /blobs./
- A blob is bound by a pair of wires from each plane.
  - Plus two "virtual" planes to provide overall bounds.
- Not all blobs actually have ionization electrons - /ghost blobs/.

Things get little more complicated when we must consider dead channels.

* What is a depo?

- A 7-tuple: $(q,t,x,y,z,L,T)$
  - 1-D longitudinal ($L$) and 2-D transverse ($T$) Gaussian sigma.
- Pre-drift $t\approx0,\ L=T=0$ (point)
- Post-drift $x=x_r,\ \{t,L,T\}>0$ (3D Gaussian)
  - $x_r$ defines the /response plane/ at which all depos pile up

* What is the true charge of a blob?

#+begin_quote
The integral of the simulated, drifted ionization electron
distribution over the pre-determined volume of one blob.
#+end_quote

Potentially expensive integral
- Large numbers of depos and blobs in typical events.
- Must precisely account for mutual time alignment.
- Blob volumes shapes are irregular polygon extrusions.
- Highly connected many-to-many volume overlaps.

Some help:
- Truncate depos to at least $3\cdot\sigma_{\{L,T\}}$.
- Depo extent is symmetric in transverse plane.
- Longitudinal and transverse blob bounds orthogonal.
- Transverse /ray grid/ coordinate system is fast.

* Some eager users of true blob charge

Graph Constraint Networks (GCoN), truth for \textbf{validation}

- Engineered "constraint functions" to update graph iterative until
  some convergence condition is met.
- Ultimately, hope to "encode" the many heuristics in WCP in a general way and apply them all together.
- Brandon Feder's topic for the summer.

Graph Neural Network (GNN), truth for \textbf{training}

- Apply GNN techniques to blob-measure (or larger) graphs.
- Expect higher precision and also sim/det bias compared to GCoN.
- Dmitrii, Haiwang and me, still ramping up.


* ~BlobDepoFill~ is an ~IClusterFilter~

3D integrates of \textbf{depos} over \textbf{blobs} in order:
1. drift direction (for one chosen time slice),
2. pitch direction (for one chosen plane),
3. wire direction (bound by each blob).


Progressively /narrows/ the scope of depos and blobs to fight combinatorics:

1. Narrow to a single ~IAnodeFace~
2. Narrow to a single ~ISlice~
3. Produce an "~s-d-w~" graph (described below)
4. Narrow to a single ~IDepo~
5. Narrow to a single ~IWire~
6. Iterate over (the narrowed) blob set finding those with current wire
7. Find bounds on this wire from other two blob layers.

* Slice-depo-wire graph

Result of each integration (drift, pitch, wire) is stored in a graph
with three types of nodes:

#+begin_quote
/slice/, /depo/ and /wire/
#+end_quote

- slice-depo :: edges hold the 1D Gaussian integral of the depo over the slice time span, ($w_{drift}$).
- depo-wire :: edges hold the 1D Gaussian integral of the depo over the pitch direction, ($w_{pitch}$).

Last integral is along wire direction and gives $w_{wire}$.

In that context we know the blob and the /graph path/ and can then
accumulate:

\[q_{blob} \mathrel{+}= w_{drift} \cdot w_{pitch} \cdot w_{wire} \cdot q_{depo}\]

The $w_{drift}$ and $w_{pitch}$ graph edge weights get reused many
times so no integral needs repeating and lookup is fast.

* Validation

Three samples of deposets in noise-free simulated PDSP detector.

- point :: a single depo
- muon :: a single muon which happens to be very /isochronus/
- cosmics :: many cosmic muons

Look at:

- Hand made plots in ~wire-cell-python~ with depos and blobs.
- Export WCT data to VTK format and view in ~paraview~.
- (todo: Bee export)

* Performance

~BlobDepoFill~ on one PDSP APA worth of blobs (no noise)

- No depos :: $\approx$ 1 ms 
- Single depo :: $\approx$ 5 ms
- Single muon :: $\approx$ 240 ms
  - Empty neighbor APAs $\approx$ 5 ms
- Surface cosmics :: $\approx$ 2-10 sec

\footnotesize
Notes:

- Using a relatively slow Xeon E5-2630 2.2 GHz
- The \textbf{surface cosmics} sample uncovers that ~BlobGrouping~ scales very poorly with #blobs:
  - Across the 6 PDSP APAs: \textbf{10-400 sec}.  The single muon: 200 ms worse case.
  - Replaced use of ~IndexedGraph~ with more targeted indexing gives $5\times$ speedup

* Exercising

#+begin_example
  wire-cell \
      -A 'detector={detector}' \
      -A 'variant={variant}' \
      -A 'indepos={indepos}' \
      -A 'outdepos={outdepos}' \
      -A 'frames={frames}' \
      -A 'clusters={clusters}' \
      -c img/test/depo-ssi-viz.jsonnet
#+end_example

Or, edit/consult ~img/test/depo-ssi-viz.yaml~ and run workflow:

#+begin_example
snakemake -jall -s img/test/depo-ssi-viz.smake all
#+end_example

Runs on several depo set files, make WCT data, plots and paraview files.

* Next steps

The ~BlobDepoFill~ is ready to use to make "true charge" blobs.

- Please keep eyes open for any problems.

We should include production of "true charge" blobs for GNN/GCoN data.
