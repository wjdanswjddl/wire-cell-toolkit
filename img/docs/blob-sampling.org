* Overview

To transition from the blobs produced by WCT tiling to the point clouds that WCT clustering operate on, the blobs must be sampled.  

* ~BlobSampling~

The sampling is orchestrated by the ~BlobSampling~ data flow graph component.  It consumes an ~IBlobSet~ and produces an ~ITensorSet~ representing a point cloud (PC).  A "point" in the PC is an abstract element to which attributes are associated.  The coordinates of the "physical point" that is sampled is represented by a specific subset of these attributes (eg, 3D Cartesian ~x,y,z~ or 2D view ~pitch,wire~ coordinates).

The ~BlobSampling~ itself merely provides object/graph I/O and delegates the sampling itself to an ~IBlobSampler~ tool component.

- ~sampler~ :: name of the ~IBlobSampler~ that actually performs the sampling.

- ~datapath~ :: root of the tensor data path (see [[../aux/docs/tensor-data-model.org][tensor data model]]).

The ~BlobSampler~ and ~BlobSampler2D~ are two implementations of ~IBlobSampler~ and each are described next.

* ~BlobSampler~

The ~BlobSampler~ samples blobs over their 3D volume by applying one or more *sampling strategies*.  In addition associating the physical point Cartesian coordinates with the PC point it may also associate a selection of a large set of additional attributes depending on configuration.

** Configuration parameters

The following configuration parameters are accepted.

- ~strategy~ :: sampling strategy.  May be null, string, object or array or strategies.  See [[Strategy]].
- ~time_offset~ :: a time added to blob times prior to any construction of time related point attributes.
- ~drift_speed~ :: used in order to translate blob time to a spatial drift position.
- ~prefix~ :: string to prepend to names of tensors in the resulting dataset.
- ~tbins~ :: int, see [[Time binning]]
- ~tmin~ :: float, see [[Time binning]]
- ~tmax~ :: float, see [[Time binning]]
- ~extra~ :: a list of strings, see [[Attribute matching]]

** Strategy

The ~strategy~ parameter describes the strategies to apply for sampling the blob in the transverse plane.  It accepts the description in flexible form which may be of the following data types:

- ~null~ :: use default strategy ("center")

- string :: provide the name for a sampling strategy, use its default configuration

- object :: provide an object with the strategy string provided by a ~.name~ attribute and the remaining attributes providing non-default strategy configuration.

- array :: an array of these types

When an *object* is provided, in addition to providing strategy-specific options, its attributes may override top-level configuration parameters for the strategy.  For example, one may override ~tbins~ for a particular strategy.

Each strategy is named and described below.

*** ~center~

Sample a single point at the geometric mean of the blob's corners.

*** ~corner~

Sample point at each of the blob's corners.

*** ~edge~

Sample point at center of each of the blob's edges.

*** ~grid~

Sample points along the sub-grid formed by stepping the ray-grid crossing points of two given planes and requiring points to be also inside the third plane.

- ~step~ :: the sub-grid step size (default is 1, in units of ray grid spacing)
- ~planes~ :: an array of two plane numbers (default is ~[0,1]~)

*** ~bound~

Points are sampled by taking steps around the boundary of the blob.  For each edge, the stepping starts but does not include the corner.  Add the ~corner~ strategy to include those.

- ~step~ :: how far to step (in units of distance)

*** ~stepped~

Similar to ~grid~ but select the two plains and form the sub-grid with a per-plane step based on the "aspect" ratio of the blob.  The sub-grid is formed as a subset of the crossing points of the view with the least and the most wires.  the step is the maximum  of a minimum step size and a step size that will take a maximum number of steps total.

- ~min_step_size~ :: minimum number of wires a step can cross (default=3)
- ~max_step_fraction~ :: the maximum fraction of total wires a step can span (default=1/12).


** Time binning

The "time binning" defines how a blob is sampled in the time dimension or equivalently along the drift direction.  The binning is specified with two bounds ~tmin~ and ~tmax~ and a number of bins ~tbins~.  The bounds are half-open and in units of one time slice.  For each transverse sampling, a point in time on a lower-edge of a time bin will be taken.

As example, the default time binning sets ~tbins=1~, ~tmin=0~ and ~tmax=1~.  With this, all points that are sampled in the transverse plane will be given a common time (and X drift location) at the start of the slice.  On the other hand, with ~tbins=2~ then transverse samplings will be duplicated with one set at the start of the slice and one half-way in the middle.  Alternatively, with ~tbins=1~ and ~tmin=0.5~ the transverse samplings will be placed longitudinally in the middle of their time slice.

** Attribute matching

Every point has a set of associated attributes.  This set is includes mandatory coordinate attributes and optional attributes specified by the ~extra~ configuration parameter.  The coordinate attributes are:

- ~x_coord~ :: (double) point X-position in the global coordinate system
- ~y_coord~ :: (double) point Y-position in the global coordinate system
- ~z_coord~ :: (double) point Z-position in the global coordinate system
- ~t_coord~ :: (double) point time

Note, ~x_coord~ and ~t_coord~ are simply derived from the ~tick~ via the ~time_offset~ and ~drift_speed~.

The optional attributes are specified by the ~extra~ configuration parameter.   This provides one or more strings interpreted as regular expressions.  They are matched against the names of available attributes from the following list:

- ~sample_strategy~ :: (int) the ID of the sampling strategy that produced the point.
- ~blob_ident~ :: (int) the blob ident number.
- ~blob_index~ :: (int) the index of the blob in the input vector.

- ~{u,v,w}blob_begin~ :: (int) wire-in-plane index that begins the bound of the blob in the plane.
- ~{u,v,w}blob_end~ :: (int) wire-in-plane index that ends the bounds of the blob in the plane.

- ~slice_ident~ :: (int) the slice ident
- ~slice_start~ :: (double) the start time of the slice.
- ~slice_span~ :: (double) the time span of the slice.
- ~tick~ :: (int) the time sample

- ~{u,v,w}wire_index~ :: (int) index of nearest wire in a plane (~IWirePlane::wires()~ order)
- ~{u,v,w}pitch_coord~ :: (double) location of point along the pitch direction.
- ~{u,v,w}wire_coord~ :: (double) location of point along the wire direction.

- ~{u,v,w}channel_ident~ :: (int) the ident number of nearest channel (~IChannel::ident()~).
- ~{u,v,w}channel_attach~ :: (int) the attachment number of nearest channel (~IChannel::index()~).

- ~{u,v,w}charge_val~ :: (double) the charge value of nearest channel.
- ~{u,v,w}charge_unc~ :: (double) the charge uncertainty of nearest channel.

* ~BlobSampler2D~

The ~BlobSampler2D~ works similarly to ~BlobSampler~ but is somewhat more simple.  It accepts the following configuration parameters. 

- ~strategy~ :: sampling strategy.  May be null, string, object or array or strategies.  See [[2D strategy]].

- ~time_offset~ :: a time added to blob times prior to any construction of time related point attributes.

- ~drift_speed~ :: used in order to translate blob time to a spatial drift position.

- ~prefix~ :: string to prepend to names of tensors in the resulting dataset.

- ~extra~ :: see [[2D attributes]].

** 2D strategy

The 2D tomographic views are sampled.  This is a sampling of "pixels" in the channel vs tick readout "image" for the view.  A "pixel" is considered "in" a blob based on its lower channel and tick bin edges.  The tick must be within the half-open time slice defining the blob.  The channel is in the blob in a given view if any wire feeding the channel is in the half-open blob bounds in that view.

The current strategies are defined:

- ~pixel~ :: all pixels in a blob are sampled.

** 2D attributes

The 2D coordinate attributes are:

- ~tick~ :: (int) the tick

- ~channel_attach~ :: (int) the wire-attachment-number of the channel

- ~plane_index~ :: (int) the index of the plane assuming ~[u,v,w]~ order

Together these make up the "pixel coordinates" of a 2D sampled point.  

The ~extra~ configuration parameter gives strings interpreted as regular expressions to match against a set of optional attributes to include in the resulting point cloud.

- ~sample_strategy~ :: (int) the ID of the sampling strategy that produced the point.
- ~blob_ident~ :: (int) the blob ident number.
- ~blob_index~ :: (int) the index of the blob in the input vector.

- ~blob_begin~ :: (int) wire-in-plane index that begins the bound of the blob in the plane.
- ~blob_end~ :: (int) wire-in-plane index that ends the bounds of the blob in the plane.

- ~t_coord~ :: (double) point time found from tick and t_offset

- ~slice_ident~ :: (int) the slice ident
- ~slice_start~ :: (double) the start time of the slice.
- ~slice_span~ :: (double) the time span of the slice.

- ~channel_ident~ :: (int) the channel ident number

- ~charge_val~ :: (double) the sampled charge (activity) value of channel and tick "pixel".

- ~charge_unc~ :: (double) the uncertainty in ~charge_val~.


Any attributes produced with the same name as used by ~BlobSampler~ have identical meaning.
