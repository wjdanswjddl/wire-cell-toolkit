#+title: Blob Depo Fill
#+include: ../../docs/include-topic.org

This replaces charge in blobs with that from overlapping depos.

* Overview

The ~BlobDepoFill~ WCT flow graph node is in the "join" DFP category.
It accepts an ~ICluster~ on input port 0 and an ~IDepoSet~ on input port 1
and produces an ~ICluster~ on output port 0.

The output retains all information from the input ~ICluster~ except that
the charge of each blob is replaced with the charge from the portions
of the input depo distribution which falls in the blob volume.  The
section [[Algorithm]] below describes how the depo charge is assigned to
blobs.  See section [[Selection]] for details on which depos are
considered and section [[Alignment]] for details on how blobs and depos
are correlated.

* Algorithm

The goal is to integrate the depo charge distribution over the volume
of each blob.  This ends up being rather complex for a few reasons.

- depo-to-blob overlap represents an N-to-M mapping with no direct way
  to form.

- both depos and blobs are numerous and the mapping is sparse.

- depos have truncated 3D Gaussian extent both longitudinally and
  transverse and this extent varies substantially across the set of
  depos due to their differing drift times.

- blobs have irregular and varied shape defined in terms boundaries
  which themselves are defined by wire rays on each of the three
  planes.
  
The algorithm joins the volumes of depos with the volumes of blobs in
a series of reductions of the full possible space.

1. Narrow to a single ~IAnodeFace~
2. Narrow to a single ~ISlice~
3. Produce an "~s-d-w~ graph" (described below)
4. Narrow to a single ~IDepo~
5. Narrow to a single ~IWire~
6. Iterate over (the narrowed) blob set finding those with this wire
7. Find bounds on this wire from other two blob layers.

The ~s-d-w~ directed (acyclic) graph associates slices to depos (~s-d~
edges) and depos to wires (~d-w~ edges).  Both edge types represent the
orthogonal integration of the depo Gaussian over a section in one
dimension.

The ~s-d~ edge property holds the integral of the the Gaussian along
the longitudinal dimension bounded by the slice's time span.

Likewise, the ~d-w~ edge property holds the integral of a section of the
Gaussian in the transverse (pitch) direction of the wires of the so
called "primary wire plane".  Which wire plane to use as "primary" is
configurable and the collection plane (index ~2~) is the default.  The
~d-w~ edge holds the result of this integral.

As the algorithm descends the narrowing listed above from slice to
depo to wire it also descends the ~s-d-w~ graph.  Reaching the wires,
the full ~s-d-w~ path is known and each blob in the current face and
slice context is checked to determine if it contains the current wire.
When it does the final integral of the Gaussian is performed.  This
requires calculating the bounds on the current wire provided by blob
boundary rays from the other planes.  The three integrals from each
dimension then scale the depo charge and the result is added to a sum
associated with the current blob.

* Selection

The ~Drifter~ produces depos at a fixed location along the drift
direction which is near to anode plane faces.  However, the set of
depos may extend transversely beyond the sensitive bounds of any one
anode plane.  A ~DepoBlobFill~ will accept only those depos within the
sensitive area of the ~IAnodeFace~ instances associated with the input
blbos.  This input selection is identical to that used by
~DepoTransform~.

As a consequence, a ~BlobDepoFill~ may be used either in a flow graph
context where it receives an ~ICluster~ with blobs from a single
~IAnodePlane~ yet depos which may span many or it may be used in a
context where the ~ICluster~ spans multiple anode planes (eg, after some
form of cross-anode "stitching").

* Alignment

In order to correlate portions of the 3D Gaussian extent of a depo
with a blob, it is likely necessary to apply a time offset to match
any time shifts applied between ~Drifter~ output and the production of
the blobs which are input to ~BlobDepoFill~.  At the least,
~DepoTransform~ may apply a time shift via its ~start_time~ configuration
parameter.  The ~BlobDepoFill~ accepts a ~time_offset~ parameter which
will be added to depo times just prior to matching them with blob time
slices.

To check for a time offset one may create paraview/vtk files for both
the drifted depos and the reconstructed blobs:

#+begin_example
$ wirecell-img paraview-depos \
  --speed '1.56*mm/us' --t0 '314*us' \
  depos-drifted.npz depos-drifted.vtp

$ wirecell-img paraview-blobs \
  --speed '1.56*mm/us' \
  clusters-img-5.zip clusters-img-5.vtu

$ paraview
#+end_example

Open the ~.vtp~ and ~.vtu~ and check alignment along the X-axis.

Note the ~--t0~ *adds* the offset to the depo time.  Likewise, the a
~time_offset~ value given to ~BlobDepoFill~ will be *added* to the depo
times prior to locating them within blobs.
