#+title: Wire-Cell Builder Waf Tools
#+include: ../docs/include-readme.org

* Overview

This repository holds [[https://waf.io][Waf]] tools used to build the [[https://wirecell.bnl.gov][Wire-Cell Toolkit]]
(and some other) software projects.  These tools are designed to
minimize the amount of "build system work" required from a developer.
Instead, the developer must provide source code files that follow some
simple naming conventions.  See section [[Conventions]].

WCT source ships with a program called ~wcb~ found in the top level
directory.  Historically, ~wcb = waf + waft~.  However starting around
version 0.25.0, WCT split ~waft~ out to this sub-package and made ~wcb~ be
merely a copy of ~waf~.  Users are free to use their own ~waf~.  Wherever
you may see reference to ~wcb~ in WCT documentation, unless any specific
words to the contrary, ~wcb~ and ~waf~ refer to the same program.

* Using ~wcb~ 

On well-provisioned systems, ~wcb~ builds the software automatically:

#+begin_example
  (1)$ ./wcb configure --prefix=/path/to/install [...]
  (2)$ ./wcb 
  (3)$ ./wcb install
  (4)$ ./wcb --tests
  (4)$ ./wcb --docs=org2html,org2pdf,doxy
#+end_example

1. A one-time step so that dependencies may be located.
2. Build the project (output goes to ~./build/~).
3. Install elements of the build to the prefix.
4. Build and execute many tests.
%. Build documentation.

In some environments, ~wcb~ may need help to find dependencies.  Hints can be given with ~--with-*~ type flags.  To see available flags use the online help:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./wcb --help
#+END_EXAMPLE

Packages can be included, excluded and located with the various ~--with-NAME*~ flags.  The rules work as follows:

1) If package is optional:

  - omitting a ~--with-NAME*~ option will omit use the package

  - explicitly using ~--with-NAME=false~ (or "~no~" or "~off~") will omit use of the package.

2) If package is mandatory:

  - omitting all ~--with-NAME*~ options will use ~pkg-config~ to find the package.

  - explicitly using ~--with-NAME=false~ (or "~no~" or "~off~") will assert.

3) In either case:

  - explicitly using ~--with-NAME=true~ (or "~yes~" or "~on~") will use pkg-config to find the package.

  - using ~--with-NAME*! with a path will attempt to locate the package without using ~pkg-config~.

When in doubt, explicitly include ~--with-NAME*~ flags.

* Conventions

The =smplpkgs= tool included in =waf-tools= provides a simple way to build a suite of software packages that have interdependencies without you, the developer, having to care much about the build system.

** Package organization 

To achieve this simplicity, some file and directory conventions for naming and organization must be followed, as illustrated:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  pkg1/
  ├── wscript_build
  ├── inc/
  │   └── ProjectNamePkg1/*.h
  ├── src/*.{cxx,h}
  ├── test/test_*.*
  ├── test/check_*.*
  └── test/wscript_check
  pkg2/
  ├── wscript_build
  ├── inc/
  │   └── ProjectNamePkg2/*.h
  ├── src/*.{cxx,h}
  ├── app/*.{cxx,h}
  └── test/*.{cxx,h}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notes on the structure:

- The "sub packages" (~pgk1~, ~pkg2~) are top-level sub-directories.
- A  ~wscript_build~ file in each sub-package to declare the name of the sub package, dependencies and any special case build rules.
- A header file =<pkgdirname>/inc/<PackageName>/Xxx.h= are considered "public" and will be made available as ~#include "PackageName/Xxx.h"~.
- Library source (implementation and private headers) go under =<pkgdirname>/src/=
- Application ~main()~ source as =<pkgdirname>/app/app-name.cxx=.
- Units tests and integration/validation tests as  =<pkgdirname>/test/{test,check}_*.*=.  See the section [[Tests]] below.

The =<pkgdirname>= only matters in the top-level =wscript= file which you must provide.  The =<PackageName>= matters for inter-package dependencies.


** The per-package =wscript_build= file

Each package needs a brief (generally single line) file called =wscript_build= to exist at in its top-level directory.  It is responsible for declaring:

- The package name
- Library dependencies
- Any additional application dependencies
- Any additional test dependencies

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  bld.smplpkg('MyPackage', use='YourPackage YourOtherPackage')
#+END_SRC

Test and application programs are allowed to have additional dependencies declared.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  bld.smplpkg('MyPackage', use='YourPackage YourOtherPackage', test_use='ROOTSYS')
#+END_SRC

** Tests

The ~waft~ tools provides substantial support for running various types
tests.  Details are provided in the document [[file:../tests/README.org]].
By default tests are not run but are activated with ~--tests~.

* Using ~wcb~ in your own project

WCT source layout has a flexible design based on the composition of
"sub packages".  In the WCT repository, a sub packages is simply a sub
directory with a ~wscript_build~.  A sub package may also exist in a
separate repository and be built separately against WCT.  They may be
built with any build system but in particular can utilize ~wcb~.  Such a
sub package is called a Wire-Cell user package (WCUP).

There are at least two options to build a WCUP,

1) Copy the ~waft~ directory into the WCUP and use ~waf~.

2) Dump ~waf+waft~ into a ~wcb~ and copy this single file to the WCUP.  See section [[Packing waft]] 

The first method is preferred if development of the WCUP requires development of ~waft~ itself.  For example, if dependencies are needed by the WCUP that are not required by WCT.  OTOH, the second method will keep the WCUP source more "tidy" as there is only a single file (~wcb~) to carry.  Neither ~waft~ nor ~waf/wcb~ need to be committed to the WCUP repository.

You may create a WCUP that itself has many sub packages like WCT
itself in which case you should mimic WCT source layout including
placing a ~wscript_build~ file in each sub directory.

More simply, a WCUP can represent a single sub package adn so will
have, eg, ~inc/~, ~src/~ and ~test/~ directories at top level.

Assuming the package name is ~WireCellUser~, the main ~wscript~ file will
largely be comprised of:

#+begin_src python
def build(bld):
    bld.load('wcb')
    bld.smplpkg('WireCellUser', use='WireCellUtil')
#+end_src

* Packing waft 

As mentioned above, today ~wcb~ provided by WCT is simply a copy of ~waf~ and the tools are read from the ~waft~ "tooldir".  It is possible to "dump" these tools so that ~wcb = waf + waft~.  This can be done simply as:

#+begin_example
  $ ./waft/refresh-wcb -o /path/to/my/WCUP/wcb
  $ cd /path/to/my/WCUP
  $ ./wcb --help
#+end_example
